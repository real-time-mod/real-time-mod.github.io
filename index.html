<h2>ABOUT THE MODIFICATION</h2>

<p>
The mod provides your Minecraft world either Server, Lan, or Single Player a real time based on the location the world is being run from.<br>
The time in the game will take into account the exact minute for the host and convert the time into ticks that the game then sets the time for the world.<br>
This makes nights and days much longer. The full day/night cycle is now on a 24 hour time period.<br>
More features are planned such as taking into account for moon phases and other environment features.<br>
<br>
Calendar<br>
There is a calendar that you can access using the key "C" by default. A purple star will indicate the day of the month the host is currently on.<br>
The months will auto update based on the host time. This allows for a more real aspect to the game seeing the date and time and even the year on the calendar.
